# Padua Tour Guide App
A [Udacity Android Basic Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803) project.  
A simple Android App showing tourist information about Padua, Italy.

that opens Google Maps and another one that opens the view with lists of places
divided in four categories:

* Visit
* Nearby
* Food

## What it Doesn't Do
It should open a detail view when a list item is clicked, but it's not 
implemented yet.
